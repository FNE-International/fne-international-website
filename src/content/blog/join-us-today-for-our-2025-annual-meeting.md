Dear Friends!

Happy Friday!

Here's the agenda for our 2025 Annual Meeting, taking place today November 1, where we'll review highlights from the past year, share updates from our country programs, and look ahead to the goals that will guide our work in 2026.

We're excited to come together for this important conversation and to officially kick off our "Shorten the Journey" Holiday Campaign.

Thank you all for your continued commitment and engagement.

We look forward to seeing you there!
