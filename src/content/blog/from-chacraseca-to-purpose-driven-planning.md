Seventeen years ago, as a college student on a spring break service trip, I first set foot in the community of Chacraseca, Nicaragua. I had no idea that a single week would quietly reshape the direction of my life.

What began as a hands-on experience (mixing cement, painting schools, sharing meals, and building relationships) slowly became something deeper. After graduation, I returned to Nicaragua to help lead service trips and later worked alongside families and small business owners through microfinance and financial literacy efforts. Being part of their daily realities showed me how access to opportunity, knowledge, and trust can change what feels possible.

One evening, lying in a hammock under the Nicaraguan sky, I had a moment of clarity:

If generosity were approached with the same care and intention as any other important decision, its impact could reach far beyond what we imagine.

That insight stayed with me and eventually shaped my professional path. Today, as a Certified Financial Planner™, Certified Exit Planning Advisor, and Chartered Advisor in Philanthropy®, I work with individuals and families who want their resources to reflect their values. My focus is helping people build financial strategies that support their lives and legacies, while also strengthening the causes that matter most to them - especially at a time when organizations doing vital international development work face growing challenges.

Over the years, I have seen how confidence and clarity can transform giving. When people understand their options and plan thoughtfully, generosity becomes sustainable. It becomes a partnership, one that allows organizations like FNE International to think long-term and respond with resilience.

My connection to FNE is deeply personal. This organization shaped how I see the world and how I choose to serve within it. I remain grateful to support FNE not only as an alumna, but as someone committed to helping others discover meaningful, intentional ways to give.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone who continues to believe in FNE's mission. The work we do together, across borders and across generations, truly does change lives.

If you'd like to learn more about how to give with greater impact while strengthening your own financial confidence, I'd love to connect and show you how strategic planning can help you continue supporting FNE's incredible work for years to come.
