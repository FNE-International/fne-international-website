José joined Niño Feliz, a special education school in Chichigalpa, in 2006. Prior to Niño Feliz, José attended preschool in his own community where there were no resources to support a blind student. None of the teachers knew Braille. After transitioning schools, and over the course of ten years, José was able to not only succeed, but to thrive. He has since integrated into secondary school at the Víctor Manuel Soto Institute. With support from FNEI, José recently received a Perkins Brailler, a tool that allows him to write. José's next goal is to attend the University of Central America.

### Fundación Juanita Scholarship Program
Fundación Juanita is a memorial scholarship project that enables girls from families with limited resources to attend public high school in the rural town of Malpaisillo, Nicaragua. After starting with just five scholarship recipients, Fundación Juanita now funds 20 girls a year, though there are many more girls in Malpaisillo who could benefit from the opportunity.

Fundación Juanita merged with FNE International to join FNEI's other scholarship and educational projects in Nicaragua, benefiting from FNEI's expertise and trained staff based in the region.

### Richard Streb Memorial Library
In the poor community of Chacraseca (subsistence farmers and artisans near León in northwest Nicaragua), a solar-powered lending library was built. The Richard Streb Memorial Library, a San Juan del Sur Library in a Box recipient, opened in February 2014.

The Richard Streb Memorial Library is Chacraseca, Nicaragua's first community library. The library honors the legacy of Dick Streb, described as "an educator and an inspiration for Peter White, and as a result thousands of others that have had the opportunity to know Nicaragua and its people."

### Dreamers Program

## VOLUNTEER TESTIMONIALS

### Hazel's Story (Nicaragua)
Hazel spent a month in Chacraseca, Nicaragua, teaching, farming, and living with a host family. What first felt like overwhelming cultural differences soon gave way to connection through cooking, music, and sports. The experience showed that shared moments—not similarities in background—are what truly bring people together.

### Arianna Rossetti - 6 Weeks in Peru (PA Student)
Her familiarity with Peru began with FNE International in June of 2015 during one of their week-long medical trips. It was the summer after her first year of PA school—she had traveled to Nicaragua with FNE for the first time a few months before, and had been inspired by the quality and sustainability of the work to return as soon as possible, this time to Peru.

They ran a week of clinics, traveling for hours each day to reach communities in the Andes that do not regularly have access to health care. A year and a half and two more trips to Nicaragua with FNE later, she returned to the Sacred Valley in December 2017 as a third year PA student for both an FNE medical trip and one of her clinical rotations.

With ultrasound, they scanned over 50 pregnant patients to ensure the fetus was developing normally. They helped explain to parents of a child with newly diagnosed Autism what to expect, and provided wound care to various patients.

**Quote**: "Giving quality care and treating each individual with importance is the first step in making a sustainable change—a concept my work with FNE International has taught me the true importance of."
